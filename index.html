  <h3 style="color:white">Sulfur Oxides and Nitrogen Oxides</h3>
  <p>Reducing the amount of electricity you use can help reduce pollutants and the resulting acid rain. Americans are dependent on electricity, and most electricity in this country is produced at power plants that burn coal. Power plants are the largest source of sulfur dioxide and a significant source of nitrogen oxide, which are components of acid rain. Solar, wind and hydro-electric power are alternatives to the polluting methods used to produce electricity. Because they do not burn fuels to produce energy, they don't produce any measurable amounts of pollution.

<h3 style="color:white">Sulfur Oxides and Nitrogen Oxides</h3>
<p>Consider public transportation and carpooling to help reduce two major pollutants. Vehicles are the largest producers of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, which are two criteria pollutants . Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen available to breathe. It is odorless and colorless, making it very dangerous to humans . Nitrogen oxide is a component of ground-level ozone, which is responsible for many respiratory illnesses, especially in children, the elderly and people with diseases of the lungs<br/><br/></p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <div class=""></div>
  <p>We are a company of Scientists in different studies and, Engineers.that give earth a better future.
Our.goal at the planet is to make cars and other things that uses CFC's and other harmful chemicals and make them into something new.
Something that won't harm us humans,animals, and our planet.
 We really want to make the world alot better and make it easy to lve in for us people and animals in the world
    <br/><br/> Ozone depletion describes two distinct but related phenomena observed since the late 1970s: a steady decline of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth's polar regions. The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole. In addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena, there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events.<br/><br/>

The details of polar ozone hole formation differ from that of mid-latitude thinning but the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of ozone by atomic halogens. The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), HCFCs, freons, halons). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by winds after being emitted at the surface.[3] Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased.<br/><br/>

CFCs and other contributory substances are referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths (280â€“315 nm) of ultraviolet light (UV light) from passing through the Earth's atmosphere, observed and projected decreases in ozone generated worldwide concern, leading to adoption of the Montreal Protocol that bans the production of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane. It is suspected that a variety of biological consequences such as increases in sunburn, skin cancer, cataracts, damage to plants, and reduction of plankton populations in the ocean's photic zone may result from the increased UV exposure due to ozone depletion.<br/><br/>
  Climate change is real. Climate change is being substantially increased by humans and the carbon we put into the atmosphere. And it appears to be speeding up. If science has made any mistakes, science has been underestimating it.   <br/><br/>James Balog<br/><br/></p>
